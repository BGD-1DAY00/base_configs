Things: 
- vim objects: 
	- vim has these objects that provide an interface for you to configure your setup, an example might be like vim.fn OR vim.api; We can look into the specific functionality exposed by each but it's all there
	- vim has its own directories that faciliate alot of the operations in your code editor, such as..
		- "data": /.local/share/nvim: manages plugins, databases, persistent state
		- "config": /.config/nvim: your configuration files
		- "cache": /.cache/nvim: temporary files
		- "state": /.local/state/nvim: session info, command history

- What is the diff between tree-sitter AND file explorer? 
        - Tree-Sitter
		- syntax highlighting (better colors for code) 
		- code folding (collapse functions/classes) 
		- smart text objects (select entire functions) 
		- identation (smart auto-complete) 
	- File Explorer: 
		- sidebar file broswer like vscode file panel 
		- visual directory tree
		- file operations (create, delete, rename) 	
	- Telescope: 
		- find files by typing partial names
		- search file contents
		- find recent files, git files, etc

things i'm adding as plugins: 
- colorscheme 
- telescope
- tree-sitter
- neo-tree
