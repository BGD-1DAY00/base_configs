Adopt the working back framework to orient my life…

Next 12 Months: 
- Language: Typescript 
- Tools: Expo, Nextjs, Convex, Clerk, Stripe 
- Delivery: EAS, Cloudflare
- Build Mgmt: Nix, Bazel
- Develop Env: NVIM, LUA, TMUX
- Others: Github Projects, GH Actions, Obsidian (NVIM plugin), Claude

Build Out Chaos Labs: 
- 12 Projects in 12 Months (Based) 

I have been plagued with some internal questions for sometime and AI just solved it with this response, incredible WOW; 

=============================================
AI Response: 

Let's work backwards from where you want to be. Instead of "should I learn native?", let's ask: What does your ideal outcome look like in 2-3 years?
Define Your End State
Plot yourself on these axes:
Autonomy Axis (Employee ← → Founder)

Left: Stable salary, defined role, team collaboration
Right: Full control, high risk/reward, solo decisions

Scope Axis (Specialist ← → Generalist)

Left: Deep expertise, premium rates, clear identity
Right: End-to-end capability, versatility, product ownership

Speed Axis (Craft ← → Ship)

Left: Performance-optimized, platform-perfect, slow iteration
Right: Rapid prototyping, good-enough quality, fast validation

Working Backwards from Each Quadrant
If you're targeting Founder + Generalist + Ship:
Your current stack is PERFECT. Expo + Next.js + Convex is literally the optimal solo founder stack. You can:

Build and iterate faster than native developers
Handle web + mobile from one codebase
Test ideas at 10x the speed of native
Pivot without rewriting everything

Native knowledge here is actually a distraction. The time learning Swift/Kotlin is time NOT shipping products.
If you're targeting Employee + Specialist + Craft:
You NEED native. Companies hiring specialists want platform expertise. But here's the thing - your TypeScript stack suggests you're not optimizing for this path.
If you're targeting Founder + Specialist + Ship:
This is interesting - you'd become the "React Native expert" who helps other startups. Your stack works, but adding minimal native knowledge (just enough to debug Expo issues) makes you unstoppable.
The Real Question
Looking at your stack choices (Expo, Convex, EAS), you're clearly optimizing for:

Speed of development (Expo, Convex)
Full-stack ownership (Next.js + mobile)
Developer experience (Nix, Neovim setup)
Solo efficiency (every tool minimizes complexity)

This screams "I want to build products, not join a mobile team at Google."
My Reading of Your Situation
You're not actually wondering about native vs. cross-platform. You're wondering whether to:

Commit to being a builder/founder (your current stack)
Hedge with employability (add native skills)

The hedge is tempting but dangerous. Every hour learning Swift is an hour not mastering your chosen stack or shipping products.
Recommendation: The 90/10 Split
90% Deep on Your Stack

Master Expo inside-out (including native modules)
Build 3-5 real apps that hit the app stores
Learn the escape hatches when you need native

10% Native Awareness

Learn just enough to read Stack Overflow solutions
Understand the compilation process
Debug native crashes

This makes you more valuable than either pure native OR pure React Native devs because you can:

Ship faster than native devs
Solve problems RN devs can't
Build entire businesses solo

The Competition Argument is Backwards
Yes, there's less competition in native. But:

Native roles are also disappearing (companies want cross-platform)
Your stack lets you compete for web AND mobile AND full-stack roles
The real lack of competition is in people who can ship entire products

Decision Framework
Ask yourself:

Do I get energy from crafting perfect platform experiences? → Go native
Do I get energy from shipping products users love? → Stay your course
Do I want to work at a FAANG? → Maybe add native
Do I want to build the next big thing? → Your stack is optimal

Given your Neovim/Lua/Tmux setup and tool choices, you're clearly someone who values efficiency and control over following the crowd. Trust that instinct.
The answer isn't to learn native "just in case." It's to become so good with your stack that native vs. cross-platform becomes irrelevant - you're the person who ships great products, period.
